Due to the complex security settings of MacOS, the issue of being unable to open software due to the "unverified developer" message may occur upon the first attempt to open the software. Please refer to the following GitHub document to see how to open software and perform tasks on your MacOS version: 

https://github.com/NaiboWang/EasySpider/wiki/MacOS-Guide

The main steps are as follows:

- Design phase - Apple Arm chip version of MacOS

1. For the Arm version, if it shows "The package is damaged", you need to do the following to run EasySpider:

2. Open the terminal command line window.

3. Switch to the EasySpider software directory, such as:

cd ~/Downloads/EasySpider_MacOS

4. In the EasySpider directory, use the following command to modify the software package attributes:

xattr -c YourEasySpider.appFilePath

For example:

xattr -c EasySpider.app

You can now open and use the software.


- Design phase - Intel chip version of MacOS

1. Due to MacOS's security policy, the system does not allow EasySpider to run when it is first opened, and it will prompt you to move it to the trash. At this point, you need to click "Cancel".

2. Open System Settings -> Security & Privacy.

3. Click "Open Anyway" (if you can't see it, scroll to the bottom).

Now, you can design tasks as you would in other operating systems.


- Execution phase

The operation is the same as the design phase of the Intel version. When running the 'easyspider_executestage' program for the first time, you need to set "Allow Anyway" in System Settings -> Security & Privacy, and re-run the "./easyspider_executestage EID" command, and click "Open" to run the task.

During the execution of the task, if an error similar to the following occurs, it can be ignored:

Traceback (most recent call last): File "multiprocessing/resource_tracker.py", line 209, in main KeyError: '/mp-5dxyey7c'

File access permissions must be granted, but microphone permissions are not needed at all. The author is also unclear why microphone access permissions would be requested, so you can refuse.
