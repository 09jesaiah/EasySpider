<!-- ## Ethics Discussion
Various fields can benefit from web crawlers due to their open access nature.
Inevitably, there will be some risk of malicious use or data infringement issue, e.g., automatic order swiping and ticket grabbing, but this is contrary to our expectations. As a tool developer, we only hope that it can be used for legitimate purposes. We advocate the reasonable and legal utilization of our system, respecting and protecting the data security and privacy. -->
