You can import tasks from other machines by simply opening the EasySpider software in this directory, right-clicking "Show Package Contents", and then placing the .json files from the tasks folder in the /Users/your user name/Library/Application Support/EasySpider/tasks folder of the other machine. Similarly, execution ID files can be imported by copying the .json files from the execution_instances folder. Please note that the .json files in both folders only support names greater than 0.
